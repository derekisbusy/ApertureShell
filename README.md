# ApertureShell
ApertureShell is a script that turns your terminal into a Portal themed terminal! It requires Python 3, to install it just drop 'startup' and 'ascii.txt' in /usr/bin/ and have your terminal open it on startup.

It also has support for custom ascii art, just modify the ascii.txt file to any ascii art of your choice! Please note that for this to work properly all lines must be of equal length, so just fill the ends with whitespace.
